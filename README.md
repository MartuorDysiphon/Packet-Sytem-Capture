## Overview

The MartuorDysiphon Packets System Capture allows users to monitor and record network-related activities, including network status, server connections, and penetration tests. The application calculates the total packets involved in each selected activity and displays a summary of the monitored activities, packet counts, and options to monitor again.

2. Choose from the available options to monitor different activities:
   - [1] NETWORK
   - [2] SERVER
   - [3] PENETRATION

3. For each activity chosen, input the number of devices connected for monitoring.
4. The application will calculate and accumulate the total packets involved in the selected activity.
5. Choose whether to monitor another activity by entering `[1]` for Yes or `[0]` for No.

6. After monitoring activities, the application will display a summary of monitored activities along with packet counts.
7. Choose whether to restart the monitoring process by entering `[1]` for Yes or `[0]` for No.
